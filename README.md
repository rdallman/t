# Not another grep tool

A stab at Boyer-Moore in Go with a grep like CLI

Inspired by ag / ack

`nag` == Not Another Grep... has potential for name, but too long

`t` is 50% shorter than `ag` and 67% shorter than `ack`

It's not very useful yet, I may do it in Rust once I get the hang of the algo.
Only takes literals at the moment.
I need github commits in the mean time ;)
